# Development environment setup
In order to contribute to the CrowdShout API documentation, you need to properly setup your development. The series of files in this `setup` directory will guide you through your installation of tools and dependencies.

This documentation project has the following development environment:
- Ubuntu 16.04 (18.04 should work)
- Node 8.4.0

To install the above on a fresh installation of Ubuntu 16.04 (or 18.04), run through the files in the following order:
1. ubuntu16.04_first_steps.md
2. install_node.md
3. install_packages.md
